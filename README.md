# name-email-database
The left side handles lookups and deletes. Search by name inside the application, and you can delete by name on the left side.
The right side handles creation and updating. To create make sure the name doesn't already exist and enter a name and email. To update do the same process for a name that already exists.
Names are case sensitive and everything is checked for exactly as it is typed.
